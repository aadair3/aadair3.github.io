Hi! I am a former high school math teacher and recent graduate from the Ph.D. in Education program at the [Rutgers Graduate School of Education](https://gse.rutgers.edu/){:target="_blank"}. My work focuses on leveraging learning science principles and artificial intelligence techniques to design, develop, and test innovative technologies for STEM teaching, learning, and assessment.

Currently, I work as a Post-Doctoral Fellow at Rutgers University, conducting research for an online science education platform called the [Inquiry Intelligent Tutoring System (Inq-ITS)]( https://www.inqits.com/){:target="_blank"}. 

With a strong foundation in educational research, data analysis, and applications of AI in education, I am passionate about advancing educational technology to enhance STEM learning experiences. My expertise spans areas such as:

* AI-driven assessment and feedback systems
* Natural language processing techniques (including applications of large language models) for automated assessment of students' writing
* Instructional design for virtual learning environments
* Project management in educational technology development
* Quantitative and qualitative (mixed methods) research methodologies in education

I am passionate about the design and development of cutting-edge technology that bridges the gap between research and practice. My goal is to contribute to projects that harness the power of AI and data science to create more personalized and effective learning environments in STEM education. I am always eager to collaborate on innovative initiatives that push the boundaries of how we teach and learn.


<!-- Hi! I am a National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Research Fellow and doctoral candidate in the Ph.D. in Education program at [Rutgers Graduate School of Education](https://gse.rutgers.edu/){:target="_blank"}.

In my work, I leverage learning science principles and artificial intelligence techniques to iteratively design, develop, and test innovative technologies for STEM teaching, learning, and assessment. Prior to graduate school, I received a B.S. in Mathematics from Louisiana State University through the [GeauxTeach]( https://www.lsu.edu/science/academics/geaux-teach-stem/index.php){:target="_blank"} program and taught high school math and robotics. 

Drawing from my former experience as a math teacher and under the guidance of my Ph.D. advisor [Dr. Janice Gobert]( https://gse.rutgers.edu/faculty/janice-gobert/){:target="_blank"}, my dissertation work focuses on automatically assessing and supporting the ways in which students develop and write about mathematical models in virtual sciences labs within the [Inquiry Intelligent Tutoring System (Inq-ITS)]( https://www.inqits.com/){:target="_blank"}. -->
