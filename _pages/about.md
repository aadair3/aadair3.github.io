Hi! I am a National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Research Fellow and doctoral candidate in the Ph.D. in Education program at [Rutgers Graduate School of Education](https://gse.rutgers.edu/).

In my work, I leverage learning science principles and artificial intelligence techniques to iteratively design, develop, and test innovative technologies for STEM teaching, learning, and assessment. Prior to graduate school, I received a B.S. in Mathematics from Louisiana State University through the [GeauxTeach]( https://www.lsu.edu/science/academics/geaux-teach-stem/index.php) program and taught high school math and robotics. 

Drawing from my former experience as a math teacher and under the guidance of my Ph.D. advisor [Dr. Janice Gobert]( https://gse.rutgers.edu/faculty/janice-gobert/), my dissertation work focuses on automatically assessing and supporting the ways in which students develop and write about mathematical models in virtual sciences labs within the [Inquiry Intelligent Tutoring System (Inq-ITS)]( https://www.inqits.com/).

Beyond academia, my overarching goal is to bridge the gap between theory and practice, bringing real-world impact to educational settings. On track to graduate in May 2024, I am enthusiastic about the potential applications of my research in shaping the future of STEM education.
