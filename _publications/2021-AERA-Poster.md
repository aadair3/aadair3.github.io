abstract: 'Although prior research on remote instruction exists (Brinson, 2015; Heradio et al., 2016), the COVID-19 crisis provides a unique context to investigate how an unexpected switch to remote instruction affects learning in difficult domains, such as science inquiry. The present study explores students’ science inquiry practice performances in Inq-ITS virtual labs prior to and during remote learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, we examined how a sophisticated educational platform that assesses students’ inquiry at a fine-grained level and scaffolds them in real time may support students even under extreme circumstances.'
