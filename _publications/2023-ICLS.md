abstract: 'Developing models and using mathematics are two key practices in internationally recognized science education standards such as the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS, 2013). In this paper, we used a virtual performance-based formative assessment to capture students’ competencies at both developing and evaluating mathematical models in science inquiry contexts aligned with the NGSS (2013). Results show that model development and evaluation competencies are correlated, but students who demonstrate proficiency with model development often struggle with evaluation. Nuanced data illustrate how components of modeling competencies differ and how they may be related.'
