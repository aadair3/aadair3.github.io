abstract: 'When implementing the Next Generation Science Standards, it is challenging for teachers to support students on inquiry practices; technological tools are a good solution to help inform teachers’ pedagogical practices. In this study, we developed actionable, evidence-based Teacher Inquiry Practice Supports (TIPS) that are presented as fine-grained real-time alerts within the teacher dashboard Inq-Blotter. These TIPS aid teachers in providing detailed support to students in order to scaffold students’ specific inquiry difficulties on the practices.'
