abstract: 'In the present study, we qualitatively examined students’ explanations about mathematical relationships between physical science variables written in a Claim, Evidence, Reasoning (CER) format. Results showed that the quality of students’ responses varied, illustrating the need for fine-grained, evidence-based rubrics that can identify precisely how students are struggling at CER so that teachers can best support students on their scientific explanation writing.'
