abstract: 'Tools that automatically assess and support students are important during remote instruction due to COVID-19 because students do not have direct access to teacher support. We present results of the remote use of virtual labs in an Inquiry Intelligent Tutoring System (InqITS), which captures student performance on practices at the intersection of mathematics and science. Implications are discussed for the development of scaffolding and design of labs to support remote instruction.'
