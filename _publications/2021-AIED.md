abstract: 'Remote learning in response to the COVID-19 pandemic has introduced many challenges for educators. It is important to consider how AI technologies can be leveraged to support educators and, in turn, help students learn in remote settings. In this paper, we present the results of a mixed-methods study that examined how teachers used a dashboard with real-time alerts during remote learning. Specifically, three high school teachers held remote synchronous classes and received alerts in the dashboard about students’ difficulties on scientific inquiry practices while students conducted virtual lab investigations in an intelligent tutoring system. Quantitative analyses revealed that students significantly improved across a majority of inquiry practices during remote use of the technologies. Additionally, through qualitative analyses of the transcribed audio data, we identified five trends related to dashboard use in a remote setting, including three reflecting effective implementations of dashboard features and two reflecting the limitations of dashboard use. Implications regarding the design of dashboards for use across varying contexts are discussed.'
