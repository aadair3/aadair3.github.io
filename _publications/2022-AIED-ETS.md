abstract: 'User-centered design (UCD), learning science and instructional design (LS&D), and AI in education (AIEd) can be powerful, yet siloed practices when developing educational products. This paper describes our Agile ways of working in the ETS® AI Labs™ and how we are taking an integrated approach to educational product development. We discuss lessons learned and ways we can bridge the gap between learning theories and practices, artificial intelligence, and user experience/research to craft effective learning solutions.'
