abstract: 'Providing high-level support to students on NGSS inquiry practices can be challenging; however, teacher dashboards can help teachers provide just-in-time instruction to students, both in-person and online. Prior work has shown some success with a dashboard that alerts teachers in real time on studentsâ€™ science inquiry difficulties, but teachers differed in their use of the alerts. To further support teachers, we designed a second iteration, in which the alerts included actionable, evidence-based Teacher Inquiry Practice Supports (TIPS), a series of suggested scaffolds that teachers can use to support students on the practices with which they are struggling. In this study, we investigate how the discursive support patterns from one teacher differed when using the dashboard alerts <i>without</i> TIPS followed by <i>with</i> TIPS. Findings suggest that TIPS influenced how the teacher incorporated different types of support for her students, and further, that the support given varied across different virtual lab stages.'
