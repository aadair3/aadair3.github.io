abstract: 'Developing proficiency in science practices, including using mathematics, outlined in the Next Generation Science Standards is essential for success in STEM courses and future careers. However, students often struggle with developing mathematical models, which limits their ability to understand scientific phenomena. To improve students’ learning and teachers’ assessment, we extended Inq-ITS to automatically assess and scaffold students’ competencies in developing mathematical models of scientific phenomena. We analyzed student data from six virtual science labs in Inq-ITS at both the practice level and the sub-practice level to determine if they maintained their mathematical competencies with scaffolding. By operationalizing and analyzing data at the sub-practice level, the results provide valuable formative data regarding the challenges students face when developing mathematical models about scientific phenomena, which in turn, can inform future scaffolds across science domains.'
