abstract: 'Students have difficulties constructing explanations and arguments in scientific inquiry. The current study made use of McNeill et al.’s (2006) claim, evidence, and reasoning framework to elicit students’ competencies with constructing scientific explanations and engaging in argumentation and natural language processing algorithms to score students’ Claim-Evidence-Reasoning statements at a fine-grained level. The analysis showed that although students would benefit from greater support in all three components, they struggled the most with particular aspects of Reasoning.'
