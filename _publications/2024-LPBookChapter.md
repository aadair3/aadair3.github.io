abstract: 'Inq-Blotter, a teacher dashboard, provides teachers with formative assessment data and actionable alerts on students’ competencies at science practices. Assessment data on students’ competencies in science practices and their respective sub-components are generated in realtime by patented algorithms as students conduct an inquiry in Inq-ITS (Inquiry Intelligent Tutoring System). This chapter begins with a description of how Inq-ITS and Inq-Blotter are used for both assessment and instruction. Following this, it discusses a study that used Epistemic Network Analysis to characterize teachers’ discourse, elicited by Inq-Blotter’s alerts, that led to robust improvement in science practices that students could apply over a series of Inq-ITS formative assessment labs.'
