abstract: 'Given the importance of developing students’ competencies on NGSS practices, the present study evaluated two different automated scoring methods for written claims, evidence, and reasoning (CER): the RegEx method and the WordDistance method. Results showed that both methods performed moderately well in scoring students’ CER responses. These findings have implications for implementing automated assessments and facilitating personalized scaffolding to support students’ CER writing.'
