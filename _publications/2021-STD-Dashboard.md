abstract: 'In this study, we examined teachers’ remote use of a science dashboard, Inq-Blotter, through discourse analyses and students’ corresponding inquiry performance in Inq-ITS. Specifically, Epistemic Network Analyses were applied to compare patterns of support elicited by Inq-Blotter when students improved versus did not improve on inquiry in Inq-ITS. Analyses revealed significant differences in teacher support patterns in relation to student improvement. These results demonstrate how dashboards can support science discourse and learning during remote instruction.'
