abstract: 'Technologies such as dashboards can support teachers’ real-time monitoring and assessment of their students’ learning. While most dashboards rely on coarse multiple-choice assessment of learning, Inq-Blotter’s data is based on educational data-mined and knowledge engineered algorithms of students’ fine-grained competencies at science practices, which are presented in actionable alerts. In this presentation, we will describe the design of Inq-Blotter and demo how it works in tandem with the intelligent tutoring system, Inq-ITS. We will also discuss our recent work on teachers’ use of Inq-Blotter to support science inquiry learning while their students engaged in real time inquiry. Specifically, we will describe results about how teacher support elicited by Inq-Blotter fostered student improvement on inquiry practices in Inq-ITS. We will also describe how epistemic network analysis was used to examine the patterns in the discursive supports provided to students by teachers. Lastly, we will describe our newest development, namely, Teacher Inquiry Practice Supports (TIPS) to further guide teachers in providing real time support to students.'
