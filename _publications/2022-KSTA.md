abstract: 'The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) emphasize the importance of using mathematical representations to model, make predictions about, and deepen understanding of science phenomena. However, students often struggle at integrating mathematics and science in a myriad of ways. Join us to learn how graphical reasoning can help students bridge the STEM gap and achieve proficiency as envisioned by the NGSS. In this interactive session, you will learn how self-grading virtual labs paired with an Artificial Intelligence-based alerting dashboard can help your students become proficient at understanding graphs, making predictions, and using mathematics to deepen content understanding. Key takeaways include: (1) deepened understanding of the design tradeoffs necessary to create rich, formative assessment activities capable of yielding fine-grained data about students’ difficulties; (2) techniques to help students who lack algebraic fluency bridge the gap between science and mathematics; and (3) research-backed ways to provide real-time feedback to students that have been shown to improve their learning. All attendees will leave with demo access to our materials that they can use immediately with students for authentic assessment and instruction of NGSS practices, specifically using mathematics (NGSS Strand 5).'
