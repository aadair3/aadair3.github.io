abstract: 'To fully realize the vision of the Next Generation Science Standards, students must be able to make sense of the scientific text that guides their inquiry and understanding of science phenomena. In this study, we analyze the text features of several investigative questions in the Inquiry Intelligent Tutoring System (Inq-ITS) to understand the ways in which the difficulty of the investigative questions relates to students’ competencies with science inquiry practices. Results show that certain word-level features (e.g., familiarity, concreteness) of the investigative questions can explain students’ performances on science inquiry, but that these features differ across science topics.'
